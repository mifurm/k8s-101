# Installing microservices

## LAB Overview

#### In this lab you will perform a deployment of microservices to the cluster and use dashboard to visualize the behaviour of Istio.

## Task 1: Creating a namespace for the deployment
1. Execute following command to create a namespace for the deployment
    ```
    kubectl create namespace srv
    ```
2. The default Istio installation uses automatic sidecar injection. Label the namespace that will host the application with istio-injection=enabled:
    ```
    kubectl label namespace srv istio-injection=enabled
    ```

## Task 2: Deploying the appliacaion
1. Download [a manifest file](files/k8s/deployments.yaml).
2. Deploy the file by executing:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f deployments.yaml
    ```
Using the deployments file you created:
* 3 service accounts
* 3 devloyments
* 3 virtual services
* ingres for all services

## Task 3: Examinig the solution
1. Verify that all services are up and running by executong following command:
    ```
    kubectl get svc -n srv
    ```
You should have 3 service running

2. Verify that istio proxy was injected to all the pods:
    ```
    kubectl get pods -n srv
    ```

    ![pods](img/app_pods.png)


3. Determine the ingress IP by executing the following command:
    ```
    kubectl get svc --all-namespaces
    ```
    and find the external IP for your ingress

4. Open any browser of your choice and open following urls:
   * ``<YOUR-INGRESS-IP>/app1``
   * ``<YOUR-INGRESS-IP>/srv1``
   * ``<YOUR-INGRESS-IP>/srv2``

    All pages should be accessible.

5. Using *bash* execute following command
    ```
    for  ((i=1;i<=100;i++)); do   curl  "<YOUR-INGRESS-IP>/app1"; done
    ```
6. Install *kiali*:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.15/samples/addons/kiali.yaml

    ```
7. Open *kiali* by executing:
    ```
    istioctl dashboard kiali
    ```
    and look into it.
8. Open **Display** menu and turn on **Traffic animation**.
9. Execute the following command once again and watch the animation :-)
    ```
    for  ((i=1;i<=100;i++)); do   curl  "<YOUR-INGRESS-IP>/app1"; done
    ```
